## EngageFT Code Challenge

#### The site consists of basic HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery code

#### To test the login function, provide these credentials:

#### Email: Sincere@april.biz

#### Password: hirePierce

##### Note: This project uses Cookies to represent 'logged-in' state. Most browsers will not save cookies on HTML pages loaded from the file system. Therefore, if you want to run this locally, you'll likely need to run a local web server. You can run the below command in terminal, from the root directory of the project, then access the site at http://localhost:1337/login.html:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337
```

##### Warning: This is a front-end only site with a mocked login, and credentials are hard-coded into the JS. This is **NOT** to be used as an actual method for authentication in the real world. Cookies are highly exposed and easily modified, and you should never, ever store credentials in front-end code. You've been warned :)
